# Single page web page
This is a single-page website.

It is set up as 2 rows with three columns
I created it so I didn't need to constantly reinvent the wheel.

The page is responsive, though it can probably be made better.

The webpage has a Navbar, a man Section and a footer.

From the footer, you can access a second page with a privacy policy.
If you use the privacy policy, update it with your details.

## AND THEN

I went off and taught myself Flask along with some Youtube vids.
Responsive, productionised and running on my online host right now.
