# Single page web page
This is a single page website.

It is set up as 2 rows with 3 columns
I created it so I didnt need to contantly reinvent the wheel.

The page is responsive though can probably be made better

The webpage has a Navbar, a man Section and a footer.

From the footwer you can access a second poage with a privacy policy.
If you use the privacy policy make sure to update it with your own details
